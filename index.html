What is Javascript ?


Javascript is designeed by Brenden IIC who is an Computer Science Programmer  and he deviolped the javascript and he developed the javascript engine and it was first introduced in the Netscape 

Javascript is an World wide Popular Programming Langauge its ranks 1st in world 

1.Javascript is an single threaded Synchronous Language 

Synchoronous Language:Executes Line by line 
Asyncoronous Language:Which will be executed Later which means it will not be going in sequential Mannner ex:Set time out,Promises and set Interval 

2.Javascript is an Scripting Language 

Scripting :Scripting Language is a programming Language that employes a high level construct to interpeter and exdecute command line by line 

3.Javascript is an Dynamic type Language 

4.Functional Programming Language 

5.Easily Interact with Web Pages 


Javascript Engine : A javascript Engine is a software Componment that executes javascript Code

1)V8 Engine -->Chrome 
2)Spider Monkey -->Mozilla Firefox 
3)Microsft Edge -->Chakra 

Javascript  Engine is Not a machine its an Programming Language 

javascript is an  JIT(just in time ) compilation i.e combination of Compiler and Interpeter


Compiler -->Where total code is going to be executed once -->Efficiency 

Interpeter -->Converts the code line by line -->Fast 

Javascript is an combination of Compiler (Efficiency)and Interpeter(fast)


TDZ:A temperal dead Zone is the area of block  where a variable is inaccessible until the moment the computer completely initlaiziates it with a value 

{

let and const (block)

}

Hoisting :Hoisting is a javascript default behaviour (or)Mecahnism where variables and function declarations are 
moved to top of there scope before code Execution

Only declarations are hoisted not initilizations


Var is an Global scope 
var can be modified
var can be redeclared 


let is an Block scope
let can be modified 
let cannot be redeclared

Const is an Block scope 
const cannot be modified
const cannot be redeclared




Type of Operator:Type of operator is used for type checking and it will return the data type of operand we pass


console.log(typeOf(operand))


Difference between == & === ?


These Both are Comparision Operators 

== compares only the values 
=== compares both value and data types 


Null :It can be called as invalid value (void)
Undefined :if we decloare an variable not initialazing any value to it is known as undefined

NAN:Nan stands for Not a Number and its an global object 

if we try to perform arithmetic operations with the operators it will try to give NAN

NAN is a number data type 

Function:Function is a block of code which is used to perform a particular task 
A function is executed when something called (invoke).
---> write once call Multiple times

syntax:function functionname( params1,params2){


//logic of code

}

functionname(arguments) --> Invoking 

Console //just for printing the output in the console 
return //end of the scope and we cant write anything after return keyword
and return values need to be store on another variable


Anonymous Function:A function which is not having any name and it should be assiged to some variable otherwise we will get error and also we cant invoke it
